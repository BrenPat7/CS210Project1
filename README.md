The client for The Gaming Room was a startup game development studio, they intended to create an game similar to pictionary but online. This game was intended to be as accessible as they could make it, without losing on gameplay, and asset quality.

My work had deep dives into the current space of the gaming industry, and attempted to be on the cutting edge of useful technology to help The Gaming Room acheive their goals. 

I really enjoyed the design document because it helepd take the realistic situation for software development, and making it as concrete as possible. It can be done with just code however with the document you are able to compare and identify the best  outcomes for a project. 

I would pick to revise the memory managment, recently I was able to take a deep dive into cloud infrastructure, how it is utlized today and how it could be used in the future, and doing so I was able to identify ways I could've been more convincing for the client and helping them understand the technology better. Most people today are weary of cloud based technoloies due to past mistakes and media coverage for holding user data. There are ways to hold user data on the device and only transmit what is needed when it is needed to ensure limited exposure to any outside intruders. 

The product will not be a success unless the user is satified. I looked at where most games can fail and seeked to improve on their faults. It is essential to keep a users interests in mind, also because not everyone has a bugatti of computers to play games, and a game cant be successful unless you are able to give comfortable playability to everyone who could possible have it. 

In the future with designing more software applications, I will utlize more comments, and graphical layouts to better visualize the structure of any appliction needed to be built.
